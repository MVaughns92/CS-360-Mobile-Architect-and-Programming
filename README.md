Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The Inventory Tracking app was designed to authenticate end users via unique username and password. Once logged in, users can edit the virtual inventory by adding items, removing items, and increasing or decreasing item quantities. Additionally, the app can send an SMS message to alert users when stock is low or zero, depending on the threshold set.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

Four screens were created for the application, beginning with the log in, there is a grid view of the inventory, adding a new item with information, and finally a screen where users have the option to allow SMS notifications for stock updates. The background color chosen was a warm beiges, consistent throughout the screens. The clickable buttons are a muted orange, showing their difference from the background. The goal was to create a gentle dynamic that wasn't overwhelming in contrast, therefore distracting. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

Initially, I looked back at Java coding assignments of mine from previous classes to get an idea of how to start. I also utilized my learning in zyBooks for how to create classes based on their example of the Band Database app. It took some tweaking as it only served as a vague base for the inventory app. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

I unfortunately did not succeed in running the app on the Android emulator, though the app did show up in the options. My xml code was able to be seen through Android Studio, seeing the elements of my screens were where I wanted them to be. 

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I found success in setting up the xml files, however, I struggled when it came to classes and the full functionality of the app. I reviewed zyBooks and tutorials for assistance.

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

Graphics have quickly become a favored aspect for me. Color choices, font sizes, and placement of elements are a strong point where I find the most success.
